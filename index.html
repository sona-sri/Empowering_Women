            <h1>Role of women in everyone's life</h1>
        <h3>THE WOMEN!</h3>
        <p class="women">Women are the pioneers of a nation and Indian culture attaches a great importance to women. It is difficult to think a sustainable development in a family without a woman in the house. There are number of roles that a woman plays in her life. Hence it won’t be wrong if we call them the super women. A woman plays multiple roles in her daily life – be it as wife, a mother, an administrator or a leader. From a mother to a wife to a businesswoman to a best friend – a woman is more than just the household queen. She sways in different areas of her life seamlessly.The status of women in India has been subject to many changes over the span of recorded Indian history.Their position in society deteriorated early in India's ancient period, especially in the Indo-Aryan speaking regions,and their subordination continued to be reified well into India's early modern period.Several women have served in various senior official positions in the Indian government, including that of the President of India, the Prime Minister of India, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. However, many women in India continue to face significant difficulties. The rates of malnutrition are exceptionally high among adolescent girls and pregnant and lactating women in India, with repercussions for children's health.Violence against women, especially sexual violence, is a serious concern in India.</p>

    <h5>(Hover over each stage)</h5>
    <div class="stages">
        <div class="first">
            <div class="one">
                <h4 class="Daughter">1) Daughter to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage1"></div>
                <p>Am sure many people will agree with me that a daughter is a bundle of joy in the household. The distinct aura and chirping nature of a daughter keep the household fill with joy and happiness. I would like to reiterate one thing that a daughter is as precious in the household as a son. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="two">
                <h4 class="Sister">2) Sister to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage2"></div>
                <p>On the other hand when she is a younger sister it is her innocent jokes, lively vibes and jovial nature make the home environment charming and vibrant. As a funny note she is a walking-talking ATM (Any Time Network) when it comes to family gossip.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="three">
                <h4 class="Friends">3) Friend to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage3"></div>
                <p>Friends play very vital role in our life. A woman’s another role in her life is as a friend. A woman is a friend to whom you can lean on when you are sad, a friend with whom you can share your happy moments and a friend who can guide you through the right path when you are puzzled.</p>
            </div>
        </div> 

        <div class="second">
            <div class="four">
                <h4 class="wife">4) Wife to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage4"></div>
                <p>She sacrifices her personal ambitions and pleasures and focuses on setting standard of morality along with maintaining peace and order within the household. She plays a pivotal role in creating the environment for her husband to think more about the economic prosperity of the family.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="five">
                <h4 class="mom">5) Mom to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage5"></div>
                <p>A role of mother is the most important and challenging for a woman. The complete burden of child-bearing and a greater part of rearing a child is borne by the woman in the house. A mother takes the major responsibility to inculcate the sense of orderliness, discipline, honesty etc. in her child.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="six">
                <h4 class="Grandma">6) Grandma to be!</h4>
                <div class="stage6"></div>
                <p>The most affectionate role that a woman plays is of a grandmother towards her grandchildren. Her loving shelter is the place where you would find the safest place to get away from your father’s anger. She is always at the disposal of her grandchild and is always ready to listen to the concerns.</p>
